Simple Object Framework
=======================

This is a collection of PHP objects developed back in 2006 to build
web applications.  It's been rotting away ever since.

It was inspired by other frameworks I was looking at around that time.

After playing with this a few months, I finally made the switch to Ruby
on Rails and never looked back.
